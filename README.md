# Training
Programming language training zone

The intention with this repository is to cluster all my attempts at learning in one location.
This is to minimize the ammount of clutter on my GitHub profile.

These are my successfull and failed attempts at starting with some languages,
and with continuing and refreshing languages that I have used before.

If you have any questions or suggestions about how to do anything you find here better,
feel free to add your input.

Thank you kindly.
